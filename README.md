# HR-predictive-model

In this project, I set out to build a predictive model, predicting a major league baseball players number of home runs based on his hitting stats from the prior season. I started by predicting off of same season data, and build on my models from there, encountering various challenges. The notebook, 'dean_cs356_final.ipnyb,' is largely in chronological order, as I worked through these challenges. The data I used is also found in this repository, under 'Batting.csv.'
